FileNation docs

We believe there is a better internet thanks to distributed technologies, and we want to make those available for everyone.

As a starting point we want to empower people to send files without any censorship. Thatâ€™s why we built FileNation.

As you can see, we already have a product and our first goal is to replace WeTransfer with blockchain technologies.

But this is just the beginning and we want to bring file sharing to the next level.

Can you Imagine a world where you can send intelligent files?

**We believe this is possible thanks to Blockchain.**

Welcome to the world of Smart Files.
